# Market-Basket-Analysis

This repository contains a Python implementation of Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm. The analysis is performed in Google Colaboratory (Google Colab), providing an accessible and interactive environment for exploring association rules in transactional datasets.

Features

Implementation: Built using Python libraries such as pandas, mlxtend, and more.

Apriori Algorithm: Utilized for identifying frequent itemsets and generating association rules.

Visualization: Tools for visualizing itemset patterns and rule significance.

Reproducibility: Ready-to-run on Google Colab.


Output Metrics

Support: The proportion of transactions containing the itemset.

Confidence: The likelihood of finding an item B in transactions containing item A.

Lift: Measures the strength of a rule over random co-occurrence.


Example Use Case

Market Basket Analysis can be applied in various domains:

Retail: Identify products frequently bought together to optimize store layouts or cross-sell opportunities.

E-commerce: Generate product recommendations based on user purchase history.

Healthcare: Analyze prescriptions for patterns in medication combinations.
